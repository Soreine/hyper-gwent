      <h1>How to configure Hyper Gwent?</h1>
      <p>
        By default, Hyper Gwent is only enabled for the Gwent subreddit. But you
        can enable it for any website.
      </p>
      <p>
        After you installed Hyper Gwent on your browser, you can access its
        status and options from the extension icon in your browser menu.
      </p>

      <h1>How do I enable Hyper Gwent on a website?</h1>

      <p>
        You can tell if the extension is running on any page by checking the
        extension icon.
        <strong>When the icon is green, then the extension is running</strong>,
        otherwise the icon is gray.
      </p>

      <p>
        To enable (or disable) Hyper Gwent on the whole website you are
        visiting, open the extension menu. Click
        <strong>Enable on this site</strong> (or <strong>Disable</strong>) to
        tell Hyper Gwent whether it should run across the current website.
        <span class="example">
          For example, if you are on <code>https://reddit.com/r/gwent</code> and
          click <strong>Enable on this site</strong>, then Hyper Gwent will be
          enabled for all pages from <code>reddit.com</code>.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        You can be more precise, and click
        <strong>Enable/Disable on this page only</strong>. This will enable or
        disable Hyper Gwent for the current page URL, and all pages that start
        with the same URL. For example, to run on By default, Hyper Gwent is
        only enabled for the Gwent subreddit. But you can enable it for any
        website.
        <span class="example">
          For example, if you are on <code>https://reddit.com/r/gwent</code> and
          click <strong>Enable on this site</strong>, then Hyper Gwent will be
          enabled on <code>https://reddit.com/r/gwent</code> but also on
          <code>https://reddit.com/r/gwent/some-sub-page</code>, and so on.
        </span>
      </p>

      <h1>Can it work anywhere?</h1>

      <p>
        In theory, Hyper Gwent can work anywhere. It does its best to work on
        complex apps like twitch.tv. But it can happen that Hyper Gwent does not
        play well with a particular website. If you have issues interacting with
        a website after enabling Hyper Gwent, disable the extension and tell me
        about it.
      </p>

      <h1 id="security">Is it safe?</h1>
      <p>
        Yes, the extension is safe. But this is a legitimate concern. Firstly,
        you should know that the extension
        <a href="https://github.com/Soreine/hyper-gwent">source code</a>
        is public. You can know everything about it, and you could even build
        the extension yourself and install it manually on your computer.
        Secondly, the extension is verified by Chrome and Firefox teams, before
        it is published on their store.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may also be worried by the permissions requested by the extensions.
        On installation, your browser will warn you about what the extension
        will have access to. I did my best to limit the required permissions to
        the minimum. Here is an explanation for each one:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <i
            >"The extension can read and change all your data on the websites
            you visit."</i
          ><br />
          This is because you should be able to enable the extension on any
          website, and to find cards in the page you visit, it needs to read the
          page's content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>"The extension can read your browsing history."</i><br />
          The extension must know the website you are currently visiting, so
          that it can be enabled on the websites of your choice, and so it can
          activates when your current tab is one of those websites. As a result,
          the extension knows the websites you visit. In other words, it could
          read your browsing history.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I hope this answers any worries you might have, otherwise do not
        hesitate to contact me.

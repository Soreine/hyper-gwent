        This is the help page for the browser extension Hyper Gwent

    <h1>Configuring Hyper Gwent</h1>
    <p>
      By default, Hyper Gwent is only enabled for the Gwent subreddit. But you
      can enable it for any website.
    </p>
    <p>
      After you installed Hyper Gwent on your browser, you can access its
      status and options from the extension icon in your browser menu.
    </p>

    <h1>Enable Hyper Gwent on any website</h1>

    <p>
      You can tell if the extension is running on any page by checking the
      extension icon.
      <strong>When the icon is green, then the extension is running</strong>,
      otherwise the icon is gray.
    </p>

    <p>
      To enable (or disable) Hyper Gwent on the whole website you are
      visiting, open the extension menu. Click <strong>Enable on this site</strong> (or
      <strong>Disable</strong>) to tell Hyper Gwent whether it should run across the current
      website.
      <span class="example">
        For example, if you are on <code>https://reddit.com/r/gwent</code> and
        click <strong>Enable on this site</strong>, then Hyper Gwent will be enabled for all
        pages from <code>reddit.com</code>.
      </span>
    </p>

    <p>
      You can be more precise, and click <strong>Enable/Disable on this page only</strong>.
      This will enable or disable Hyper Gwent for the current page URL, and
      all pages that start with the same URL. For example, to run on By
      default, Hyper Gwent is only enabled for the Gwent subreddit. But you
      can enable it for any website.
      <span class="example">
        For example, if you are on <code>https://reddit.com/r/gwent</code> and
        click <strong>Enable on this site</strong>, then Hyper Gwent will be enabled on
        <code>https://reddit.com/r/gwent</code> but also on
        <code>https://reddit.com/r/gwent/some-sub-page</code>, and so on.
      </span>
    </p>

    <h1>Limitations</h1>

    <p>
      Hyper Gwent is not meant to be enabled on every website. It does its best to work on apps like messenger.com
      without breaking them. But Hyper Gwent might not play well with some websites. If you have issues interacting
      with a website after enabling Hyper Gwent, disable the extension and <a href="https://airtable.com/shrgU3jbaF1gkban7">tell
        me about it</a>.

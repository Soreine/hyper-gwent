    <div class="description">
      <p>None of us can reasonably remember every possible Gwent card's name and effect. Browsing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gwent/">r/gwent</a>
        or reading deck guides can be challenging if you don't know half the cards people are talking about.</p>
      <p>Hyper Gwent is an extension that detects card mentions and adds tooltip to them. It is running on this page.
        See by yourself:<ul>
          <li>Speartip asleep is almost as scary as Speartip awake.</li>
          <li>ADC does not stand for Attack Damage Carry.</li>
          <li>Villentretenmerth is hard to pronounce. But Borkh isn't!</li>
          <li>I know a joke, it goes like this. Three guys named Gigni, Gyrden, Gaard enter a bar...</li>
          <li>One recruit, two recruits, three recruits...</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <div class="emote">
        <div class="avatar geralt"></div>
        <div class="emote-text">Not bad. Not bad at all.</div>
      </div>
      <p>Maybe you are new to the game. Or you have hard time keeping up with the latest card changes. Or, like me, you
        can't remember crap. Don't worry then, Hyper Gwent got you covered. Hyper Gwent automatically detects card
        names, aliases or acronyms in the pages you visit, highlights them and shows a tooltip when hovering them.</p>
      <p>Feature list:<ul>
          <li>Includes all existing cards, up to date with the latest patch</li>
          <li>Support abbreviations, acronyms, plurals, missing capitals, missing accents, and missing punctuation</li>
          <li>Non obstrusive. Add subtle highlights and does not break links.</li>
          <li>Fast. You could enable it on any website, you would not feel it's here.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Incoming features:<ul>
          <li>Enable on any website with a simple click (currently only enabled on r/gwent and GwentDB)</li>
          <li>Automatic card updates</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>What do you think of that, Dandelion?</p>
      <div class="emote">
        <div class="avatar dandelion"></div>
        <div class="emote-text">That… was actually rather impressive. Congratulations.</div>
